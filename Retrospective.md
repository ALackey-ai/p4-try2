## Experience

This project was alot more fun than the other projects, not just because it was "simpler", but because I just genuinly think that threads are really cool. Yes they are hard, I mean I didn't finish the project, because of multiple reasons, mainly time and bad circumstances but still, multithreading is fun and I'm excited to redeem myself on p5. 

## Known issues or Bugs

I'm not 100% sure but what me and Eric think is because I accepted the github classroom assignment so early and before I suppose "the changes" were added I think there was something that just wasn't part of my repo that should have been. Well I don't think so, I know so because the build commands just don't work. Like at all. And so me and Eric tried to create a new repo from the same repo that p4 was forked from. Hence why you are reading this here in this repo. (Unless you are reading the copy of this that I put into my p4 project...). Anyways long story short it builds in this repo just fine but I also wasn't able to figure out how to get the debugger to work. So between not building and not being able to debug I choose the first. Therefore I just had a hard time trying to figure out what was causing some of my errors. I think I got most of the tests to pass, its says I'm getting 6 of 9 passing for me.

## Sources used

Mostly the book but here and there I used stackoverflow for syntactical things.
